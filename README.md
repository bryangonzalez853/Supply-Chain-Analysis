# Supply-Chain-Analysis
supply chain analytics project where I analyzed over 5,400 orders from a distribution company. Using Python, I discovered they had an 84% on-time delivery rate when the industry standard is 85%. I identified $115,000 in potential savings from optimizing shipping routes and preventing stockouts.
